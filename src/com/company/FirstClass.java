        //we are giving them
        //When we access a variable the computer is figuring out by himself
        //where the variable is stored on the RAM and gets the value from there
        //a variable value can be changed during the program
        //To create a variable:
        //1. Identify the type
        //2. Give a name
        //3. optional- Give a value (the value is usually a literal)

        //Creating a variable is also called declaring a variable.
        //Giving it a value for the first time is also called initialization

        //While you can name your variable almost anything, there are some rules.
        //A variable name should start with an alphabetic character (like a, b, c, etc.)
        // and can include letters, numbers, and underscores _.
        // It must be all one word with no spaces.
        //Use meaningful variable names!
        //Start variable names with a lowercase letter and use camelCase.
        //Variable names are case-sensitive and spelling sensitive!
        // Each use of the variable in the code must match the variable name in the declaration
        // exactly.
        //Never put variable name inside quotes (” “).

        //we can define our variables by lot of different types, those are called data types.
        //All the data types are keywords
        //int- abbreviation for integer, a whole number without any decimal points

        //is a String literal in Java. It's value can't be changed unlike a variable.

        //you used.

        //There are two types of variables in Java: primitive variables that hold primitive
        //types and object variables that hold a reference to an object of a class.

        // (like a UPS tracking number helps you find your package).
